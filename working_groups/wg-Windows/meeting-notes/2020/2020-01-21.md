## Issues Discussed

### PY2/PY3 Issues
Minion connection issues (5 min) in Py3
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/54447
- Makes it difficult to transition to PY3 with these issues
- profiling/debugging the minion (yappi) to figure out why it takes 5 min

code page issues (cp437) in languages other than English
- Non latin characters cause errors
- a possible solution:
    - set codepage to 65001 in batch files, service startup, etc
    - remove code in `_run` that sets it to 437
    - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/cmdmod.py#L578

### MSI Issues

Possible problem with the new versioning schema
- 3000 is not going to work for the MSI
- Will need to go with something like 30.00.00
- Markus has been using 19.2.2

MSI build to be included in the Salt build scripts
- run the `build_env` script
- then run the `build` script

removing visual studio from msi to remove complexity
- There's a lot of code in the msi repo that allows you to build from Vuisual
  Studio. This adds to the complexity of the code and could be removed.

## Action Items
Shane:
- Build master with Python 3.6.8
- Fix issues
- Add MSI to the build scripts
- Send Markus any issues found during the build process
- Try Markus' suggestions to fix the unicode issues
- Merge pending PRs on the salt-windows-msi repo

Markus:
- Send Shane a method of testing the Unicode issue

Peter:
- Generate a formula for demonstrating salt usage in Windows
- Show how to spin up different builds of Windows for testing
- Possible demo next meeting
- I think he said he was using Travis-CI
