- Discussed Previously:
  - dafyddj demonstrated the changes to winrepo using the salt client to set
    architecture grain so we can test urls properly. Using the salt loader
    directly and creating a dummy object for the registry module. This allows
    the tests to be run on Linux instead of Windows.
  - Making powershell the default shell on Windows needs to be a discussion
  - The MSI Error 2738 could have been the vbscript issue. Looks like this has
    been fixed.
  - pkg.install function on Windows needs a force option
  - lgpo_reg:
    - Currently writes the registry as well, maybe we need to make that
      configurable
    - User policies are set in the context of the service account. They probably
      shouldn't be written to the registry at all as that is applied when the
      user logs in.
    - Need to create a module that will generate a state based on the contents
      of the Registry.pol file. This could/should be a salt extension
- Noteable PRs:
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/68056
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/68066
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/68088
- Community Issues and Discussion
  - Tenable Scans causing DoS on master
    https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/66519 (issue)
  - Community maintainers need clear guidance on what we want them to do. If
    the maintainer has an hour to give to Salt, what should they do? We need a
    policy document with clear guidance.

## TODO
- Twangboy: Investigate the pkg.install 3006.10 issue
            https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/67902
- Twangboy: Any idea when the next 3006.11 will happen
- Twangboy: Investigate making powershell the default shell on Windows
- Twangboy: We need to communicate better with our community volunteers exactly
            what we want them to do... how they can contribute.
- Dafydd:   Investigate pythonnet
            https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/hosting-powershell-in-a-python-script/
- Dafydd:   Create an issue for the lgpo_reg module to not write user policies
            to the registry as those should be handled by Windows when the user
            logs in
