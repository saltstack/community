## Notes

### Understanding of running salt-master as non-root

* End users potentially making changes to permissions that negate some of the security benefits of running salt-master as non-root user

* Need clearer guidance on that - documentation needs updating

* Still a number of outstanding issues around how perms setup/managed by package installs

### Python 3.14 t-strings

* Python 3.14 is introducing t-strings. Large part of the reason for this is to improve handling of strings combined with untrusted data. 

* PEP787 is looking to leverage t-strings to improve safety of sub-process module

* Once available, it would be worth looking at subprocess usage throughout salt and looking to leverage t-strings to standardise sanitisation methods.

* Discussed when we could rely on having 3.14. Final release for 3.14 will be October. 3008 will be targetting 3.13, so likely to be 3009/3010.

* Supported versions of python for Salt now based on what onedir is using

### Getting others involved

* Call to action on Community call and in follow up notes

* Get issues up on [project board](https://github.com/orgs/saltstack/projects/58) for visibility

### Ongoing issues

* No further progress
