# Agenda
 - walkthrough of how doing releases of Salt at SUSE
 - goals to do the same with other distros, aiming to learn and improve
 - maybe Tiamat review


# Notes
 - (PSH) reviewed agenda 
    [see slide 02; 
        https://github.com/saltstack/community/projects/60 
        https://github.com/saltstack/community/issues/143 ]
 - (AG screenshare) walkthrough of SUSE Salt release process
    [see slide 03;
        https://github.com/openSUSE/salt/wiki#opensuse-salt-packaging ]
    - SUSE supports multiple distributions, including openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise
    - use "OBS" (Open Build Service; [not Open Broadcast Software]) to build
    - new Salt releases amounts to creating new branch on openSUSE
    [see slide 04;
        https://github.com/openSUSE/salt-packaging/tree/3000/salt ]
    - helper tool generates patches, in a different repo (Git on github)
    - SUSE uses upstream tarball as is, with patches on top
    - Git commit messages, often a single line, are used to autogenerate Changelog
    - OBS can build containers and OS images
    [see slide 05:
        https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:saltstack:products ]
    - due to "political reasons", SUSE does not change the version number
    - RPM spec file quick review
    - "MU branches are complicated" [seem ok to ignore initially]
    - OBS follows a similar process to Git with "branches"
    - OBS uses a "service" file
    [see slide 06]
    - OBS also builds for different distributions, including CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu
    - "nothing from pip is used directly; only SUSE's own validated RPMs"

 - Q/A for walkthrough of SUSE Salt release process
    - BD Q - "version number review"
        "upstream version-release.rebuild"

    - FG Q - "do you package full Salt or just minion client for other distros,
      and why? are Windows builds included?"
        [answered in part by OBS screenshare; full Salt is built if possible]
        "SUSE builds various Salt packages for another software product they
        support 'uyuni' (spacewalk successor)
        [ https://www.uyuni-project.org/ ]
        "no current support for Windows"

    - FG Q - "are repos accessed only by SUSE employees, or also community?"
        "SUSE uses open development model hosted on github, and are open to
        community contributions; though few are received"
        "in OBS members have 'submit' and 'review' process, much like Git and github"
     [see slide 07
        https://build.opensuse.org/package/requests/systemsmanagement:saltstack:products:testing/salt ]


 - (17:30) (Randy) impromptu review of "tiamat"
    [ ? https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/tiamat ]
    - overview "pop wrapper to pi-installer"; helps build any codebase
    - pulls in all deps via requriments, source package
    - also includes shared libraries (optional)
    - creates a dynamic binary, "staticx"
    [ ? https://pypi.org/project/staticx/ ]
    - still in beta; systemd bug starting
    - tiamat is used at GoDadddy
    - BD Q - purpose?
        "easier deployment of Salt, via a single binary for master, minion"
        "lower entry to deploy code"
    - unclear if a Salt Project priority, but GoDaddy is using it
    - shared library security patches can optionally be used
    - pip security updates, "pip install within binary"
    - RT has some ideas to support SUSE model of using RPMs instead of pip
    - regular tiamat contributors include "Pedro, RT, and ?'karl'"


 - (17:45) Open Table
   - BD "patches" and getting all patches upstream
     - Debian has ~15-20 currently; SUSE has hundreds
     - ideally upstream patches have open MR/PR
     - AG "SUSE tries to present patches upstream" "some patches are SUSE specific"
     - PSH "SUSE procedures require upstream PR with patches"
   - PSH review next meeting action items [see below]
     - check if there is interest in OBS quick intro?
   - next meeting in 1 month [FIXME: actual date]


# Action Items
 - ?Debian (or Gentoo) prepare presentation of Salt release flow
   - (FG) could be open to drafting some slides for Debian Salt Team review

 - (17:56) close call
