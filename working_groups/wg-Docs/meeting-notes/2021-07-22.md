## salt-extensions

Where is the documentation for Salt extensions?

- Need to improve docs for [`salt-extension`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt-extension) repo. Should minimally include links to:
  - [PDF of extensions presentation](https://saltproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-3-26-salt-extensions.pdf)
  - [Extensions presentation on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhomJkwxK3Q)
  - [Example index of salt extenstions (not production ready)](https://extensions.saltproject.io/#salt-tidx2-extension)

## Next steps

- Publish the `salt-user-guide` to `docs.saltproject.io/salt/user-guide/`
- Publish the `salt-install-guide` to `docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/`
- See about implementing Algolia (or simply DuckDuckGo) for the current as-is docs portal

### Misc tasks

- Update docs landing page for book link:
  - Old link: http://www.oreilly.com/webops-perf/free/network-automation-at-scale.csp
  - New link: https://www.cloudflare.com/network-automation-at-scale-ebook/
- Duplicate content from [VMware KB on Upgrading Salt](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/50122319?lang=en_US&queryTerm=upgrading+your+salt+infrastructure) to install guide via [issue in `salt-install-guide`](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-user-guide/-/merge_requests/57)
  - Recent **Salt Air** mentioned that the `salt-master` doesn't need to be upgraded before minions
    - Upgrade documentation can say that we **recommend** upgrading the `salt-master` before upgrading minions.
- Add [Quick Guide to Vault Integration](https://web.archive.org/web/20210306232428/https://help.saltstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041140451-Quick-Guide-to-Vault-Integration) tutorial to `salt-user-guide`
- [Modify the main landing page of `salt-install-guide`](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-install-guide/-/issues/13)
- Confirm that Google tagging and analytics are stripped out where currently existing
- DuckDuckGo: Simple poc for docs landing `docs.saltproject.io`

## Going forward

The goal of the next Salt Docs Working Group is to continue our action-oriented
approach: assigning issues, seeking help with issues, and working toward achieving
the long-term goals by completing tasks step-by-step. We'll go over issues available,
MRs/PRs needing review/feedback, and what progress has been made.

The current focus will continue be on:
- [`salt-user-guide`](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-user-guide)
- [`salt-install-guide`](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-install-guide)

Issues are available in both repos, and are open for contributions!
