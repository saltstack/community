# 2021-03-04 Meeting

## Attendees

- Derek Ardolf
- Jim Cser
- Gary Giesen

## Meeting Details

### Announcements

- Docs Clinic next week: March 11th
  - Need to get on the Twitch calendar!

### Future of the working groups and docs clinics

Will we continue doing Docs clinics and the working group?
- Yes! We are going to try running it for another month or two to see whether
  it is a continued, viable workgroup to run. With Alyssa leaving us, Derek is
  now the main captain of the ship, along with fellow Docs heroes. The Docs
  Clinics will continue to run on alternate weeks, streaming on Twitch:
  - [SaltStackInc Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/saltstackinc)

### Follow-Up Items from last meeting

- Verify that we don't use Google Analytics with new docsets (verified!)
- Verify that `furo` theming is Debian-friendly and devoid of tracking tools (verified!)
  - Google analytics, youtube links, etc. (YouTube has special embed for no tracking)
  - If any extra steps are needed for Debian-friendliness, can figure that out.

**Already has issue**: Style guide linting/automation:
  - Created an issue for `salt-user-guide`: https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-user-guide/-/issues/25
  - `salt-user-guide` provides us the opportunity to move faster, and develop
    great style guide tooling, which could evolve into tools for use in any
    Salt project with Sphinx docs.

### Next Docs Jam idea: PR salt/58112

[EPIC] Documented options in minion/master config files don't match
minion/master config documentation, and vice versa
- PR: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58112
- Create automation to generate issues for all of the options?
- This is complex, as many options require research:
  - Is this option documented in one place, and just needing to be duplicated
    to another doc? (Easy Mode)
  - Is this option missing from other places because it is deprecated, and
    needs to be removed?
  - Is this option only meant for master or minion config docs?
  - Is this option completely undocumented, and needing deeper research to
    properly document it in configs? (Hard Mode)

This seems to make most sense for a docs jam, because this will seriously be
as many as 100 issues, or more, that make up this EPIC.

### salt-user-guide and Salt docs

Future of Sphinx theme with HTML:
- https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo
- Questions to ask ourselves with themes:
  - Search: We use Google CSE, we need to move off of it
    - duckduckgo as an alternative to managing/integrating CSE?
    - Level-up built-in Sphinx potential: https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork
    - Algolia to search across all docsets?
    - Version-targeted search queries

Since **search** is a huge subject, I think we initially do the following:
- Get off CSE
  - MVP: Built-in Sphinx search, for A/B docs testing
  - Level-up: duckduckgo as an alternative to managing/integrating custom search or stork
    - Stork: https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork

Algolia may require more dev work, and it is much more powerful in potential
in that it can assist in unifying all of our docsets under one search tool.
Should be revisited.

Breaking up Salt docs that should belong in `salt-user-guide`:
- `salt-user-guide` to become the primary topics/subjects of the salt docs, while all docstring generated docs stay within the `salt` repo.
- We should experiment with new UX and TOC / navigation of both the core reference
  module docs and the `salt-user-guide`. Do so while working with the `furo` theme.
  - I am actively working on this UX / TOC piece, and want to have A/B site ready
    for testing by end of month if I can.

### Issues to create: We must document!

Issues need to be created to ensure we don't lose track of these:

- Docs code/example test automation:
  - Look into both Sphinx (doctest?) and other tooling for setting up and testing
    example code.

### Next events

- Docs clinic: March 11th, 2021
- Docs working group event: March 18th, 2021

### Misc. notes for future

> This is a placeholder for notes not belonging anywhere else

- Test suite: skip/ignore `*.rst` and `*.md` files for the Python test suite in `salt`. Only run Sphinx docs tests.

### Misc. projects

- [idem-cloud](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/idem-cloud)
  - [pop-create](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/pop-create): Docs bootstrapping and project templating
- GitLab API: Should really evaluate! Jim mentioned working on GitLab, specifically API documentation that involved openapi: https://gitlab.com/jimcser/gitlab/-/tree/jimcser-openapi-access-tokens/doc/api/openapi
  - This could provide some insight into the potential of autogenerative code for baseline execution modules in [`idem-gitlab`](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/idem-gitlab)
- Awesome lists, bookmark automation
  - Derek made some PRs to `awesome-*` lists that help autogenerate bookmarks for a simplified way to import an awesome list into your webbrowser.
