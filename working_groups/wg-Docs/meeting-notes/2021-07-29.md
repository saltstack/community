## What we worked on this meeting

**Derek**

- Currently updating `repo.saltproject.io`, before dedicating time to `salt-install-guide`
  - Updating the page with content related to single-binary
  - Reference as **Single-binary (BETA)**

**Gary**

- `salt-user-guide` cleanup tickets/issues

**Bryce**

- Meticulously reviewing Derek's work

**Dave**

- Also meticulously reviewing Derek's work

**Gareth**

- Delta proxy docs: should they belong in the `salt-user-guide` or the `salt-install-guide`?
  - Will be included in Silicon
  - Perhaps belongs in `salt-user-guide`, since it is a `salt` configuration and is available out-of-box

### GitHub/GitLab features of note

> Example from [pypa/pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/new/choose)

**Code-block copy buttons in Markdown**

Normally, only copy buttons appear in HTML rendered docs, but this looks to be changing (at least, with Markdown files, issues, and PRs, on GitHub).

## Going forward

The goal of the next Salt Docs Working Group is to continue our action-oriented
approach: assigning issues, seeking help with issues, and working toward achieving
the long-term goals by completing tasks step-by-step. We'll go over issues available,
MRs/PRs needing review/feedback, and what progress has been made.

The current focus will continue be on:
- [`salt-user-guide`](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-user-guide)
- [`salt-install-guide`](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-install-guide)

Issues are available in both repos, and are open for contributions!
